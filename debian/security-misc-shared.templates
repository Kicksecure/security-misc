_Description: Manual intervention may be required for permission-hardener update
 No need to panic. Nothing is broken. A rare condition has been encountered.
 permission-hardener is being updated to fix a minor bug that caused
 corruption in the permission-hardener state file. If you installed your own
 custom permission-hardener configuration, some manual intervention may be
 required. See:
