## We allow devices that were plugged in before the daemon starts. Everything
## is blocked as the default. Following rules apply on top of this.

## Explicitly reject any interface that is not documented and/or defined by
## USB.org.
## Note: Most probably superfluous.
reject with-interface none-of { 00:*:* 01:*:* 02:*:* 03:*:* 05:*:* 06:*:* 07:*:* 08:*:* 09:*:* 0a:*:* 0b:*:* 0d:*:* 0e:*:* 0f:*:* 10:*:* 11:*:* 12:*:* 13:*:* 14:*:* 3c:*:* dc:*:* e0:*:* ef:*:* fe:*:* ff:*:* }

## Explicitly reject any device with a mouse/keyboard interface in
## combination with some other interface.
## Mice and keyboards should likely never have non-HID interfaces provided
## alongside them.
reject with-interface all-of { 03:*:* 00:*:* }
reject with-interface all-of { 03:*:* 01:*:* }
reject with-interface all-of { 03:*:* 02:*:* }

## Explicitly reject any device with an RNDIS interface. RNDIS is believed to
## have protocol-level buffer overflow vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed.
reject with-interface one-of { ef:04:* }

## Allow all mouses and keyboards, in a sense, so the user can conveniently
## change them without restrating the daemon.

## Allow only one keyboard to be connected
allow with-interface equals { 03:01:01 } if !allowed-matches(with-interface equals { 03:01:01 })
## Allow only one mouse to be connected
allow with-interface equals { 03:01:02 } if !allowed-matches(with-interface equals { 03:01:02 })
## NOTE: Some HID devices will have an interface of 03:00:00 - these are HID
## devices that do not support a "boot interface". **These are blocked
## entirely.** It is very likely that this will cause issues with some mice
## and keyboards. Also note, all HID devices other than mice and keyboards
## will be blocked, **including touchscreens.**

## Allow USB audio devices. The intended functionality of these devices is
## unlikely to be usable in a malicious capacity without having already
## compromised the machine.
allow with-interface equals { 01:*:* }

## Allow USB video devices (i.e. webcams). Also tricky to use in a malicious
## manner without having already compromised the machine.
allow with-interface equals { 0e:*:* }

## Allow USB mass storage, if and only if the USB device only has the mass
## storage interface and nothing extra.
## Suspicious interface combinations with mass storage are blocked.
allow with-interface equals { 08:*:* }

## Allow USB hubs, these are likely safe and are required for Qubes OS USB
## passthrough to work.
allow with-interface equals { 09:*:* }
