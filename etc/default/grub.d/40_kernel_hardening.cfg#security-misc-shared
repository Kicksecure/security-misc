GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX slab_nomerge"

## Enable sanity checks and red zoning of slabs via debugging options to detect memory corruption.
## Sanity checks force additional verification steps on every memory allocation and free operation.
## Red zoning adds extra metadata to each object to detect writes beyond the object's boundaries.
## As a by product of debugging, this will implicitly disabling kernel pointer hashing unless manually re-enabled.
## Enabling this (for now) will therefore leak exact and all kernel memory addresses to root.
## Introduces a noticeable performance overhead during all memory allocation and deallocation operations.

## Force immediate system reboots on the occurrence of a single kernel panic.
## Increases resilience and limits impact of denial of service attacks as system automatically restarts.
## Ensures the system does not hang forever if a panic occurs, reducing susceptibility to both cold and warm boot attacks.
## Immediate rebooting also prevents persistent information disclosure on panic details that were dumped to screen.
##
## KSPP=yes
## KSPP sets CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT=-1.

#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX panic=-1"

## Force the kernel to immediately panic on "oopses" and kernel warnings in the WARN() path.
## Panics may be due to false-positives such as bad drivers.
## Both allowed limits are set to one so that panics occur on the single first instance of either scenario.
## Oopses are serious but non-fatal errors.
## Certain "oopses" can sometimes indicate and thwart potential kernel exploitation attempts.
## Warnings are messages generated by the kernel to indicate unexpected conditions or errors.
## By default, code execution continues regardless of warnings emitted by macros like WARN() and WARN_ON().
## Note that by forcing kernel panics on oopses and warnings, this exposes the system to targeted denial of service attacks.

## Force the kernel to immediately panic if it becomes tainted.
## Using kernel documentation, one can select a subset of taints to create a security policy.
## Requires summing the numbers for each taint state and then converting it to a hexadecimal bitmask.
## Some example combinations are shown below.
## S - Panic on using out of specification hardware: 4 = 0x4.
## B - On the above and bad page faults or some unexpected page flags: 36 = 0x24.
## A - On the above and ACPI tables are overridden by users: 292 = 0x124.
## I - On the above and severe firmware bugs: 2340 = 0x924.
## N - On the above and in-kernel tests have been run: 264484 = 0x40924.
## J - On the above and userspace has used a mutating debug operation in fwctl: 788772 = 0xC0924.
## G/P, O - On the above and the loading of proprietary or out-of-tree modules: 792869 = 0xC1925.
## All must first be tested to ensure there are no pre-existing issues on user hardware.
## After confirming stability this reduces attack surface.

## Switch (back) to using kCFI as the default Control Flow Integrity (CFI) implementation.
## The default implementation is FineIBT as of Linux kernel 6.2.
## The Intel-developed IBT (Indirect Branch Tracking) is only used if supported by the CPU.
## kCFI is software-only while FineIBT is a hybrid software/hardware implementation.
## FineIBT may result in some performance benefits as it only performs hash checks at the destinations.
## kCFI mandates hash validation at the source (which is randomized), making it more difficult to bypass.
## FineIBT is considered weaker against attacks that can write arbitrary executables into memory.

## Enable AMD Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).
## SME encrypts memory with a single key at the kernel level to protect against cold boot attacks.
## SEV extends SME to VMs by encrypting the memory of each with a unique key for guest isolation.
## SEV-ES (Encrypted State) extends SEV by encrypting each guests virtual CPU register state during VM exits.
## SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging) extends SEV by activating hardware-level memory integrity.
## This is hardware-based encryption managed by the proprietary and closed-source AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP).
## Both require a compatible AMD CPU and support for SME to first be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.
## Likely unavailable in consumer-grade AMD CPUs where Transparent SME (TSME) can be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI to achieve SME.
## Note the corresponding Intel Total Memory Encryption (TME) can also be enabled via the BIOS/UEFI.
## May cause boot failure on certain hardware with incompatible DMA masks especially if IOMMU is disabled.
