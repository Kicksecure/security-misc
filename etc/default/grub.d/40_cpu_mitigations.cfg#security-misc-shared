## For complete protection, users must install the latest relevant security microcode update.
## BIOS/UEFI updates should only be obtained directly from OEMs and/or motherboard manufacturers.
## Note that incorrectly performing system BIOS/UEFI updates can potentially lead to serious functionality issues.
## The parameters below only provide (partial) protection at both the kernel and user space level.

## If using Secure Boot, users must also ensure the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (DBX) is up to date.
## The UEFI Revocation List contains signatures of now revoked firmware and software used in booting systems.
## If using compatible hardware, the database can be updated directly in user space using fwupd.
## Note that incorrectly performing DBX updates can potentially lead to serious functionality issues.

## Enable a subset of known default mitigations for some CPU vulnerabilities and disable SMT.
## Note that this redundant parameter simply applies each mitigation at the already applied default settings.
## The default values are not always the strictest and so we reapply each below to their highest setting.
## We retain it here for completeness as many other distributions heavily rely on this for many CPU mitigations.

## Disable SMT as it has been the cause of and amplified numerous CPU exploits.
## The only full mitigation of cross-HT attacks is to disable SMT.
## Disabling will significantly decrease system performance on multi-threaded tasks.
## Note, this setting will prevent re-enabling SMT via the sysfs interface.

## KSPP=yes

## - Downgrade "l1tf=full,force" protection to "l1tf=flush".
## - Regenerate the dracut initramfs and then reboot system.
