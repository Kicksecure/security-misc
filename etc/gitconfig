## Generally a good idea but too intrusive to enable by default.
## Listed here as suggestions what users should put into their ~/.gitconfig
## file.

## Not enabled by default because it requires essential knowledge about OpenPG
## and an already existing local signing key. Otherwise would prevent all new
## commits.
#[commit]
#	gpgsign = true

## Not enabled by default because it would break the 'git merge' command for
## unsigned commits and require the '--no-verify-signature' command line
## option.
#[merge]
#	verifySignatures = true

## Not enabled by default because it would break for users who are not having
## an account at the git server and having added a SSH public key.
