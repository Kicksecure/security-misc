## kexec_load_disabled:
##
## A toggle indicating if the kexec_load syscall has been disabled. This value defaults to 0 (false: kexec_load enabled), but can be set to 1 (true: kexec_load disabled). Once true, kexec can no longer be used, and the toggle cannot be set back to false. This allows a kexec image to be loaded before disabling the syscall, allowing a system to set up (and later use) an image without it being altered. Generally used together with the "modules_disabled" sysctl.

## Disables kexec which can be used to replace the running kernel.

## Restricts the use of ptrace to root. This might break some programs running under WINE.
## A workaround for WINE would be to give the wineserver and wine-preloader ptrace capabilities. This can be done by running:
##
## sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
## sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/bin/wineserver
## sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/bin/wine-preloader
